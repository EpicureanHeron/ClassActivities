// Rock, Paper, Scissors

// Listen for key press R P or S by human, store in variable HumanChoice

// Then computer choses a random number between 0-2 which will be referred to in an array which held r p s, array is called choices

// compare random computer choice vs pressed key based on logic, porbably a function (or three?), should have 9 or 10 total (with ties)

//if human chose rock and and PC chose s

// rock beats if 

// S beats P

// P beats R

// if PC choice === Human choice, tie (end of if statement "Else" )

// Determine if PC or Human won, probably part of the function that says who won, set it to a variable 

// Add to to the displayed wins, losses, and ties
