  "description": "nstructions Create an app with Express, MySQL and Handlebars. HINT: this app will be very  similar to the app your instructor just demonstrated and slacked out. Please feel free to  leverage that code when creating this code. Create a schema.sql file and create the following  inside of that file: Make a database called “wishes_db” Inside of that database, make a table  called “wishes” which will have a wish column and an id column. The id will be automatically  incremented while also being the primary key. Run your schema.sql file within MySQL Workbench  before moving onto the next steps. In your server.js file, you will have to create two routes: a  get route for ‘/’ and a post route for ‘/’. Render all of the wishes from the wishes table when  the ‘/’ get route is hit. Additionally show the form that the user can use to create a new wish.  The form will POST to the ‘/’ route. The ‘/’ post route will insert the wish from the form into the wishes table and will redirect  the user back to the ‘/’ get route.",
